# goNaturalUSA app

Welcome to goNaturalUSA app. Why this name ? This name emphasizes the natural beauty and serenity of the national parks. It suggests a focus on the landscapes, wildlife, and the overall experience of being in nature.

## Overview

This app is a guide, inspiration, recolection of the best way to prepare to visit the USA National Park.

### Problem

One of our hobbies is discovering new places and enjoying nature, and one of our wishes is to visit each national park because they offer wild and beautiful views, adventures, and an easy way to immerse ourselves in nature and absorb great vibes. When I begin to plan a trip, I find myself typing and visiting various websites such as Google Maps, YouTube, Kayak, Skyscanner, and Visitacity. I would like to create an app that consolidates everything in one place to assist me in building my trip and, at the same time, to be mindful of my budget. In other words, I aim to travel on a budget and plan my next adventure where it is most convenient.

#### User Profile

The app will be designed for individuals who want to learn, explore, or visit the USA national parks in the most convenient way. Users should be able to view a map of the USA, indicating the location of each park by state (facilitated through this visual representation). They can then select a park they wish to explore and discover the best prices through a link that identifies the optimal travel destinations for a specific time and location. Additionally, users can find a link to help them build a travel plan for a specific city or state, allowing them to explore top places efficiently.

##### Features

Parks Descriptions, Location and links in the Home-Page /  Gallery Functionality: A robust feature to help users see beautiful pictures of the park using a Google Image API.

My data are coming National Park Service Data Store.


###### APIs

I am using the NPS API . The National Park Service API (application programming interface) and developer resources are designed to provide authoritative NPS data and content for internal and external developers creating apps, maps, and websites. You'll find photos and essential information about NPS sites including visitor centers, campgrounds, events, news, alerts, and more, as well as detailed articles about NPS natural and cultural features and important people and places.

###### Notes

The site was developed to be reactive and to change the format at three sizes:

less than 786 pixels > then use mobile formatting
between 786 pixels and less than 1280 pixels > then use tablet formatting
more than 1280 pixels > then use desktop formatting
